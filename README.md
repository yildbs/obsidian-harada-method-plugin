# Draw Harada Method : Obsidian Harada Method Plugin 
This plugin is a tool to draw The Harada Method. 

# What is the Harada Method?
It is famously used by Japanese baseball player Shohei Otani to achieve his goals. The Harada Method has various names such as Mandara chart, Mandal-art, and Open window 64 chart. Anyway, the key point of The Harada Method is that it helps you set goals, break them down, and achieve them. Create your own 1 goal, 8 plans, and 64 actions!
